        <h1>Questions &amp; Answers</h1>

        <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
        <p>
          Your data stays in your Google Sheets. For voice recognition and parsing, we rely on OpenAI's security and data-privacy standards.
          We do not store your voice recordings or parsed data on our servers. If relying on OpenAI is not enough for your requirements, please
          talk to us. We can help you set up a comparable AI model of your choice inside your own premises or a secured cloud environment.
        </p>

        <h3>Can Voilo access all my files on Google Drive?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Voilo cannot browse or read your Google Drive. It only has access to the spreadsheets it creates itself for your trackers.
          It does not have the ability to look at, list, or open any other files in your Drive.
        </p>

        <h3>Will Voilo make mistakes?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, mistakes can happen. Speech recognition and AI parsing are not perfect. Voilo reduces errors through real-time transcription,
          AI parsing, and validation (e.g., checking dates, numbers, or categories). If something looks wrong, you'll see it on the confirmation
          screen before anything is written to your Google Sheet, and you can correct it. If you run into repeated issues, please let us know —
          it helps improve the system.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Voilo work offline?</h3>
        <p>
          Partially. You can record and store entries while offline. When you're back online, the stored items remain in your list. You can then
          manually select which ones you want to process and submit to Google Sheets. This ensures you don't lose any data, while keeping you in
          full control of what gets uploaded.
        </p>

        <h3>I don't have a Google account. Can I use Voilo?</h3>
        <p>
          Not yet. Voilo currently stores all tracker data in Google Sheets, so a Google account is required. We are exploring alternatives for
          the future. If you prefer a different storage solution, please let us know — your input directly influences what we support next.
        </p>

        <h3>I already have a to-do app and track my steps. Why should I use Voilo?</h3>
        <p>
          Voilo isn't meant to replace specialized apps you already use. Its purpose is different: it gives you one simple way to record any kind
          of data, not just predefined categories. Your information stays in your Google Sheets, where you can analyze, visualize, or export it
          however you want. It's also helpful for tracking things traditional apps don't support — without needing a new app for each use case.
        </p>

        <h3>Can Voilo process input from other apps?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Voilo can handle more than live voice recordings. You can send audio from other apps — such as Voice Memos, WhatsApp, or similar —
          directly to Voilo using the share sheet. Voilo will then transcribe and parse it just like a normal recording. You can also import images
          from your photo library; Voilo extracts the text automatically using OCR. And if you prefer, you can share plain text from apps like Notes.
          All of these sources go through the same parsing workflow, so you can record or capture data however it fits your moment.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I lose my data when I change a tracker's structure later?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Voilo doesn't delete or overwrite your data. When you change a tracker — for example by adding, removing, or renaming columns —
          Voilo creates a new version of the tracker. Your existing entries keep their original structure and stay exactly as they were. New entries
          follow the updated structure. This way your history remains intact, nothing breaks, and you can adjust your tracker over time without
          risking any loss of data.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens to my voice recordings after processing?</h3>
        <p>
          Voilo does not keep your recordings after they have been processed. Your audio is sent securely to Apple's Speech API for transcription
          and then discarded. We do not build a long-term archive of what you say. If you ever need a setup where audio must not leave your own
          infrastructure, talk to us — we can help you configure an alternative model or deployment that fits your requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>Can Voilo get confused if I have similar trackers?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Voilo only records into the tracker you have actively selected. It does not try to guess which tracker you meant, so entries cannot
          end up in the wrong place. If you switch trackers frequently, you can always check the active tracker before recording.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need to speak in a specific format?</h3>
        <p>
          No. You can speak naturally. Voilo is designed to understand everyday sentences like "I worked on the app for two hours today." You do
          not need to use fixed commands or special syntax. If something is unclear, you can correct it during the confirmation step before submitting.
        </p>

        <h3>What if I make a mistake while speaking?</h3>
        <p>
          You can always review and correct everything before it goes into your Google Sheet. If the transcription or parsing looks wrong, you can
          adjust the fields manually on the confirmation screen, or discard the recording and try again.
        </p>

        <h3>How does Voilo handle accents, dialects, or background noise?</h3>
        <p>
          Speech recognition is generally robust, but not perfect. Clear speech in a reasonably quiet environment gives the best results, and strong
          accents or loud background noise may reduce accuracy. If you run into recurring issues, please let us know — it helps us improve the system.
        </p>

        <h3>Does using Voilo count against my Google Sheets quota?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, in the same way any manual entry would. Voilo writes new rows into your spreadsheet through the standard Google Sheets API. Extremely
          large trackers may eventually reach Google's row limits, but this is uncommon for everyday use.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I export or back up my Voilo data?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. All your data is stored in Google Sheets, so you can export it at any time to formats like Excel or CSV. Voilo does not create a
          separate data store, so you remain fully in control of where your information lives.
        </p>

        <h3>What if Voilo stops working or I cancel my subscription?</h3>
        <p>
          Your existing data remains in your Google Sheets because Voilo never stores your tracker data itself. If you cancel your subscription,
          you may lose access to certain features, but your historical data remains available to you at all times.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Voilo use my data to train AI models?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Your data is not used to train any AI model. Voilo uses Apple's Speech API for transcription and OpenAI for parsing, and neither uses
          API data for training. Voilo does not use your data for training, either. If you require stricter privacy guarantees, talk to us — we can
          help set up an isolated model.
        </p>

        <h3>Will Voilo drain my battery when listening?</h3>
        <p>
          Voilo only uses the microphone while you are actively recording. It does not run continuous background listening. Real-time speech
          recognition does use some processing power, but comparable to other apps that record audio.
        </p>

        <h3>Can Voilo remind me to record data regularly?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. All trackers support reminders, and you can configure them manually to match your routine. Some blueprints include predefined
          reminder settings, so trackers created from those blueprints come with a suggested reminder already set up. These reminders are simple
          notifications to help you stay consistent with tracking.
