        </p>

        <h2>1. Overview of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          Voilo is a productivity application that helps users record voice input and convert it into structured data that can be written into Google Sheets.
          The App performs the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Converts speech to text using Apple's Speech API</li>
          <li>Extracts structured data using OpenAI APIs</li>
          <li>Writes data into your own Google Sheets through the Google Sheets API</li>
          <li>Stores tracker configurations and pending entries locally on your device using Apple SwiftData</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Voilo does not:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Store your voice recordings after they are processed</li>
          <li>Maintain servers that store personal data</li>
          <li>Access or read any Google Drive files except those you explicitly select or create for use with Voilo</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Future versions may use a backend server for anonymized click-stream analytics to improve usability. Personal data will not be stored without user disclosure and consent.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Your Account and Google Integration</h2>
        <p>Using Voilo requires signing in with a Google account to allow the App to:</p>

          <li>Create spreadsheets for your trackers</li>
          <li>Write data to your chosen Google Sheets</li>
          <li>Access sheet metadata (e.g., column names)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Voilo cannot browse or access other files in your Google Drive. You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintaining control of your Google account</li>
